# Grunt tasks for TypeScript development

This project is a simple Grunt setup to help with TypeScript development
by compiling TypeScript to JavaScript, and minifying the resulting JS files.

## Grunt tasks

```
// watch 'src' directory for changes to .ts files, runs build task
$ grunt watch

// compile .ts -> .js, combine and minify resulting output
$ grunt build
```
